Artifact Naming Guidelines
--------------------------

The following artifacts are named with version:
*	AMIs
*	VirtualBox VMs
*	VirtualBox images (files)
*	Vagrant box files
*	Packer output directories for VirtualBox builders

The following artifacts are named without version:
*	Vagrant boxes

The following artifacts are named with version and timestamp:
*	Packer manifests

Each obtainment of artifact is made with explicit version:
*	AMIs - with version tag
*	VagrantBox images - with version specified
	in names of directory and file
*	Vagrant boxes - with built-in version property

Use of `most_recent` filter is prohibited.

Labels in names are named according to Semantic Versioning
with the following interpretations and deviations:

1.	Environment name is considered as the part of the name. It is
separated from the base name with hyphen `-` and precedes a version.

2.	Architecture and builder (provider, format) are considered as build
metadata.

3.	If timestamp is present it is appended in the end with hyphen `-`
separator.

4.	In the names of the following artifacts plus `+` separator is
replaced with low line (ground) `_`:

	*	VirtualBox VMs
	*	VirtualBox images
	*	AMIs
	*	Vagrant box files
	*	Vagrant boxes

5.	The version can contain pre-release label as usual.
